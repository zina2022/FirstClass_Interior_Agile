    <h3>Kanye West</h3>
    <p><b>'Legend' would be an understatement to describe this figure. Kanye West, designer, rapper, philanthropist, icon. Kanye, after releasing Donda, his latest album out at the time of writing, disappeared from the face of the planet. Having seemingly retired from rapping indefinitely, he decided to venture into the interior design world as to flex another skill of his varied repertoire. "God lead me here. My mother lead me here. It's nice and relaxing doing this and allows me to show everyone what I'm all about".<br>
